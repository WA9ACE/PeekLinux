*
*   BRIEF:          This file defines the API of the BTHAL UART hardware driver.
*
*   DESCRIPTION:    General
*
 * BTHAL UART Driver API layer
 *
 *     	The UART hardware driver is a set of functions used by the UART
 *     	transport to exchange data with Bluetooth radio hardware. If you
 *     	are porting the stack to a new hardware platform, you must provide
 *     	the UART functions described here.
 *
 *     	If your system will require an interrupt service routine (ISR) to
 *     	handle UART receive and transmit events, we recommend that you create
 *     	a high-priority driver thread. When an event occurs, the ISR should
 *     	simply signal the thread, then exit. This minimizes the time spent
 *     	in interrupt mode. The driver thread then reads or writes data and
 *     	indicates events as described below.
 *
 *     	If it is not possible to create a separate, high-priority driver
 *     	thread, the interrupt may issue the required callback events itself.
 *     	BTHAL_UART_Read and BTHAL_UART_Write must then be designed to operate 
 *	   	in interrupt mode (BTHAL_UART_Write is also called from the stack task).
 *
 *     	Some operating systems take care of the ISR internally, and provide
 *     	an API to read and write UART data. In this case, the high-priority
 *     	driver thread receives its signals from the operating system instead of
 *     	a custom ISR.
 *
 *		Because data structures in the transport driver are modified both by 
 *		the stack task and the hardware context (which may be an interrupt or 
 *		a task, depending on its design), there is a possibility that data may 
 *		become corrupted because both contexts may attempt to access the data 
 *		concurrently.
 *		As a result, OS_StopHardware and OS_ResumeHardware must surround any 
 *		access to data structures that may be used by both the hardware context 
 *		and the stack task. Because these functions prevent the hardware 
 *		thread/interrupt from executing, the time spent between OS_StopHardware 
 *		and OS_ResumeHardware should be kept to a minimum. 
 *		Furthermore, the transport layer must never call an HCI API layer 
 *		function while in OS_StopHardware mode.
 *
 *     	If a high-priority thread is used, OS_StopHardware and OS_ResumeHardware
 *     	can be implemented using a mutual-exclusion semaphore. 
 *	   	If only an ISR is used, then OS_StopHardware and OS_ResumeHardware 
 *	   	should disable/re-enable UART-related interrupts.
 *
 *		At any time a write is not pending, the hardware driver should revert to 
 *		“read mode” in which it is sensitive to incoming bytes from the UART. 
 *		UART reads are handled entirely within the context of the hardware driver’s 
 *		task or interrupt.
 *
 *		It is very important that callback events are provided in the correct order. 
 *		For instance, if data has been written to the transport and data is 
 *		subsequently received through the transport, this should be reflected in
 *		the order of callbacks to the UART Transport Driver: first send a 
 *		UE_WRITE_COMPLETE event, then a UE_DATA_TO_READ event.
*

 * BTHAL_UART_Init()
 *
 * Brief:  
 *	    Called by the stack (during ME_RadioInit) to initialize the UART hardware
 *      driver. 
 *
 * Description:
 *	    Called by the stack (during ME_RadioInit) to initialize the UART hardware
 *      driver. This function should perform the following tasks:
 *
 *      1) Initialize all local memory.
 *
 *      2) Open and initialize the communications port using OS-specific
 *      calls.
 *
 *      3) Initialize a thread or interrupt service routine to process
 *      communications port events.
 *
 *      4) Register a callback function. When a read or write event occurs, 
 *      the UART hardware driver calls the callback function with the 
 *      appropriate event.
 *
 *		Initialization can occur synchronously or asynchronously. 
 *		Returning BTHAL_STATUS_SUCCESS from BTHAL_UART_Init informs the 
 *		transport layer that initialization is complete. 
 *		BTHAL_STATUS_FAILED indicates that initialization failed. 
 *		BTHAL_STATUS_PENDING indicates that initialization will happen 
 *		asynchronously and that an event (UE_INIT_COMPLETE) will be passed 
 *		to the transport layer when initialization is complete.
 *
 * Type:
 *		Asynchronous/Synchronous
 *
 * Parameters:
 *		func [in] - Callback function to call with events.
 *
 * Returns:
 *		BTHAL_STATUS_SUCCESS - Indicates that initialization was successful.
 *
 *     	BTHAL_STATUS_PENDING - Indicates that initialization was started and
 *          a notification will be sent when initialization is complete with
 *			the event UE_INIT_COMPLETE.
 *
 *     	BTHAL_STATUS_FAILED - Indicate that the port could not be opened
 *          or that some other initialization error occurred.

 * BTHAL_UART_Shutdown()
 *
 * Brief:  
 *      Called by the stack (during shutdown) to release any resources
 *     	allocated by the BTHAL_UART_Init function. 
 *
 * Description:
 *	    Called by the stack (during shutdown) to release any resources
 *     	allocated by the BTHAL_UART_Init function. This may include closing
 *     	the communications port, killing the I/O thread, deregistering
 *     	the interrupt service routine, etc.
 *
 *		Shutdown of the transport will occur when ME_RadioShutdown is called. 
 *		Shutdown can occur synchronously or asynchronously like initialization. 
 *		The return codes are the same and, if it occurs asynchronously, an event
 *		(UE_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE) must be passed to the transport layer upon completion. 
 *		During shutdown, the following tasks should be performed:
 *
 *		1) Free (closing) the hardware port.
 *
 *		2) Deregister the interrupt service routine or terminate the driver task.
 *
 * Type:
 *		Asynchronous/Synchronous
 *
 * Parameters:
 *		void.
 *
 * Generated Events:
 *      UE_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE
 *
 * Returns:
 *		BTHAL_STATUS_SUCCESS - Indicates that shutdown was successful.
 *
 *     	BTHAL_STATUS_PENDING - Indicates that shutdown was started and
 *         	a notification will be sent when shutdown is complete with
 *			the event UE_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE.
 *
 *     	BTHAL_STATUS_FAILED - Indicate that the port could not be closed
 *         	or that some other error occurred.

 * BTHAL_UART_Read()
 *
 * Brief:  
 *	    Called by the stack to read bytes from the UART.
 *
 * Description:
 *	    Called by the stack to read bytes from the UART.
 *
 *     	When the UART driver first detects that data has been received, it
 *     	notifies the stack by calling the callback with the
 *     	UE_DATA_TO_READ event. During processing of this callback, the
 *     	stack calls BTHAL_UART_Read repeatedly until all available data has
 *     	been read.
 *
 *     	This function must not block. If no bytes are currently available,
 *     	BTHAL_UART_Read returns 0.
 *
 * Type:
 *		Synchronous
 *
 * Parameters:
 *		buffer [in] - Buffer to fill with received bytes.
 *
 *		length [in] - Maximum number of bytes to read.
 *
 *		readBytes [out] - The number of bytes actually copied into "buffer". 
 *			If no more bytes are available, BTHAL_UART_Read returns 0.
 *
 * Returns:
 *		BTHAL_STATUS_SUCCESS - Indicates that the reading was successful.
 *
 *     	BTHAL_STATUS_FAILED - Indicate that the reading could not be performed
 *         	or that some other error occurred.

 *
 * Brief:  
 *	    Called by the stack to begin writing bytes to the UART.
 *
 * Description:
 *	    Called by the stack to begin writing bytes to the UART.
 *     	This function must not block, but return immediately after
 *     	initializing the write.
 *
 *     	This function is first called by the stack thread. When the UART
 *     	driver determines that the caller's buffer is free, it calls the
 *     	callback function with the UE_WRITE_COMPLETE event. 
 *		During processing of the event, BTHAL_UART_Write may be called once to 
 *		provide more transmit data to the hardware driver.
 *
 * Type:
 *		Asynchronous
 *
 * Parameters:
 *		buffer [in] - Bytes to write.
 *
 *		length [in] - Number of bytes in "buffer".
 *
 *		writtenBytes [out] - The actual number of bytes sent to the UART. 
 *			Returns 0 if a transport error occurred.
 *
 * Generated Events:
 *      UE_WRITE_COMPLETE
 *
 * Returns:
 *		BTHAL_STATUS_PENDING - Indicates that the writing was started and
 *         	a notification will be sent when shutdown is complete with

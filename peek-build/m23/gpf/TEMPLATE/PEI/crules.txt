                     C-Rules and and the Pei-Templates
                     =================================

This file contains some remarks to the C programming rules
and how they are applied in the pei template files xxx_pei.c,
xxx.h, (and mon_xxx.h).

- xxx_pei.c contains a prototype definition for a static function.
  This is permitted (e.g. to avoid warnings), but not mandatory.

- #define for compiler switches (e.g. '#define ENTITY_XXX' in xxx_pei.c)
  usually appear before the "sections", like INCLUDES, CONSTS, TYPES,...

- T_QMSG is a structure written before the C Coding Standard was in force.
  Therefore, its members don't diverge from the rules about names.

- ClearCase - in contrast to some other versioning systems - does not
  support default string replacements like $Version:$ in the controlled files.
  Nevertheless it is possible to apply a self-written function that inserts
  an identification string in the files. This function usually is not
  called on each checkin, but e.g. for a delivery. The string $Identity:$
  in the header of the files is assigned for keeping this possibility.
